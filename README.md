## Workflow
The file `n8n-flow.json` contains an n8n workflow triggered when a WooCommerce order is completed. A Webhook node listens for POST requests on the `woocommerce-order-completed` path. The workflow sends a WhatsApp message via an HTTP request every day for 15 days and on days 1, 3, 5, 9, 14 and 15 it also sends an email via another HTTP request node. Wait nodes pause one day between messages until the final email on day 15.
